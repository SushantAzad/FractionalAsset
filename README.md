# üè† Fractional Asset

**Fractional Asset** is a revolutionary web application that democratizes real estate investment in India by enabling fractional ownership of properties through asset tokenization technology. Inspired by **NPCI's asset tokenization initiatives**, this platform allows users to buy as little as **1% of a property**, making premium real estate accessible to everyone.

Just like owning shares in a company, users can own **digital tokens representing fractions of real estate assets**, with ownership cryptographically secured on a decentralized network. The platform transforms traditionally illiquid assets into **liquid, tradeable tokens** that can be transferred instantly ‚Äì similar to sending money via UPI.
